These functions look at the\n\t * current selector and can generate CSS for the styles in their subtree by\n\t * calling the callback with a new selector.\n\t *\n\t * For example, when generating styles with a base selector of '.foo' and the\n\t * following styles object:\n\t *\n\t *   {\n\t *     ':nth-child(2n)': {\n\t *       ':hover': {\n\t *         color: 'red'\n\t *       }\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t * when we reach the ':hover' style, we would call our selector handlers like\n\t *\n\t *   handler(':hover', '.foo:nth-child(2n)', callback)\n\t *\n\t * Since our `pseudoSelectors` handles ':hover' styles, that handler would call\n\t * the callback like\n\t *\n\t *   callback('.foo:nth-child(2n):hover')\n\t *\n\t * to generate its subtree `{ color: 'red' }` styles with a\n\t * '.foo:nth-child(2n):hover' selector. The callback would return CSS like\n\t *\n\t *   '.foo:nth-child(2n):hover{color:red !important;}'\n\t *\n\t * and the handler would then return that resulting CSS.\n\t *\n\t * `defaultSelectorHandlers` is the list of default handlers used in a call to\n\t * `generateCSS`.\n\t *\n\t * @name SelectorHandler\n\t * @function\n\t * @param {string} selector: The currently inspected selector.
